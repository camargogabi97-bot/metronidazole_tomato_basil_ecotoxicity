# metronidazole_tomato_basil_ecotoxicity

This repository contains the processed data and supporting materials used in the scientific article: "Metronidazole Toxicity to Basil and Tomato: A Terrestrial Ecotoxicological Study". The aim is to make the research more transparent and its results more reproducible.

The data and files here support three main parts of the study:

    1.Germination Test Maps and Germination Rates.

    2.Analysis of Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) Plates.

    3.Densitometric Analysis of TLC Images.

üìÇ Folder Structure and Contents

/Germination/

- Contains the data and calculations from the germination test, including the cultivation germination map and corresponding germination rates.

/Thin-Layer Chromatography/

- Files related to the TLC analysis. This includes the high-resolution digital image of the chromatography plates.

- The plates developed with DPPH and under UV light (365 nm) with NP, which were used to verify phenolic substances.

- The detailed protocol for preparing the plates is also available in this folder.

/Densitometric analysis/

- This file contains the chromatographic plates used for quantification, along with the densitometric results for the extracts. It also includes the plate used for the analytical curve and its corresponding graph.
