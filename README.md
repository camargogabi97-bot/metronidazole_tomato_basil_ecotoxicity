# metronidazole_tomato_basil_ecotoxicity
This repository contains processed data used in the article: Metronidazole Toxicity to Basil and Tomato: A Terrestrial Ecotoxicological Study 

The data support three main parts of the study:
(1) Germination test maps and germination rates
(2) Analysis of TLC plates
(3) Densitometric analysis of TLC images


ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure and Contents

/Dataset/Germination/

Contains materials related to cultivation:
 - A file with the cultivation germination map and the germination rate calculations.

/Dataset/Thin-Layer Chromatography/

Contains materials related to TLC plates:

- The TLC plates were used in computational densitometry.

- A high-resolution digital image of the plates.

- Plates developed with DPPH and under UV 365 nm with NP for the verification of phenolic substances.

The protocol used for the preparation of the plates.

/Dataset/Densitometric analysis/

- This file contains the chromatographic plates used for quantification, along with the densitometric results for the extracts. It also includes the plate used for the analytical curve and its corresponding graph.
